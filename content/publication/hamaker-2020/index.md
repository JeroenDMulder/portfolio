abstract: "Scientific research can be categorized into: a) descriptive research, with\
  \ the main goal to summarize characteristics of a group (or person); b) predictive\
  \ research, with the main goal to forecast future outcomes that can be used for\
  \ screening, selection, or monitoring; and c) explanatory research, with the main\
  \ goal to understand the underlying causal mechanism, which can then be used to\
  \ develop interventions. Since each goal requires different research methods in\
  \ terms of design, operationalization, model building and evaluation, it should\
  \ form an important basis for decisions on how to set up and execute a study. To\
  \ determine the extent to which developmental research is motivated by each goal\
  \ and how this aligns with the research designs that are used, we evaluated 100\
  \ publications from the Consortium on Individual Development (CID). This analysis\
  \ shows that the match between research goal and research design is not always optimal.\
  \ We discuss alternative techniques, which are not yet part of the developmental\
  \ scientist's standard toolbox, but that may help bridge some of the lurking gaps\
  \ that developmental scientists encounter between their research design and their\
  \ research goal. These include unsupervised and supervised machine learning, directed\
  \ acyclical graphs, Mendelian randomization, and target trials."
