abstract: 'The random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) is rapidly gaining
  popularity in psychology and related fields as a structural equation modeling (SEM)
  approach to longitudinal data. It decomposes observed scores into within-unit dynamics
  and stable, between-unit differences. This paper discusses three extensions of the
  RI-CLPM that researchers may be interested in, but are unsure of how to accomplish:
  (a) including stable, person-level characteristics as predictors and/or outcomes;
  (b) specifying a multiple-group version; and (c) including multiple indicators.
  For each extension, we discuss which models need to be run in order to investigate
  underlying assumptions, and we demonstrate the various modeling options using a
  motivating example. We provide fully annotated code for lavaan (R-package) and Mplus
  on an accompanying website.'
