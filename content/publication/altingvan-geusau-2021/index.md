abstract: It is useful to investigate factors that could predict treatment outcomes
  for PTSD. The current study aims to investigate the relationship between daily measured
  PTSD symptoms during an intensive six-day treatment program and overall post-treatment
  outcomes. The treatment program combines eye movement desensitization with reprocessing
  and prolonged exposure, as well as physical activity and psychoeducation. It was
  expected that for the entire duration of treatment, as well as the first half of
  the treatment, a greater decline in daily PTSD symptoms would be a predictor for
  a greater decline in PTSD symptoms at a four-week follow-up. Data from 109 PTSD-patients
  (87.2% female, mean age = 36.9, SD = 11.5) were used. PTSD symptoms were measured
  with the CAPS-5 and the self-reported PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Daily PTSD
  symptoms were measured with an abbreviated version of the PCL-5 (8-item PCL). Latent
  growth curve models were used to describe changes in daily PTSD symptoms and predict
  treatment outcome. Results show that a greater decline in daily PTSD symptoms measured
  by the 8-item PCL predicts better treatment outcome (CAPS-5 and PCL-5), but that
  a patient's PTSD symptoms on the first day of treatment has no predictive effect.
  A decline in PTSD symptoms only during the first half of treatment was also found
  to predict treatment outcomes. Future research should be focused on replicating
  the results of the current study.
