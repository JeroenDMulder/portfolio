My name is Jeroen, and I am a PhD candidate at the Methods and Statistics department of Utrecht University. My research project concerns the development of mathematical models to study developmental processes (e.g., reading and mathematics skills in children, or the development of psychopathologies). Specifically, my interest is in how different designs and statistical techniques can be used to allow for causal inferences. I also enjoy my involvement in the statistical education programs for bachelor, master, and graduate students. 

Furthermore, I have an interest in audio, and as such I have been working as a radio DJ at both local (TV Enschede FM, BataRadio) and national radio stations (NPO KX, NPO Radio 2). Nowadays, I am developing a podcast in which I discuss current topics from a statistical point of view.
